// This pseudocode should create a report that contains an
// apartment complex rental agent's commission. The
// program accepts the ID number and name of the agent who
// rented the apartment, and the number of bedrooms in the
// apartment. The commission is $100 for renting a three-bedroom
// apartment, $75 for renting a two-bedroom apartment, $55 for
// renting a one-bedroom apartment, and $30 for renting a studio
// (zero-bedroom) apartment. Output is the salespersonâ€™s
// name and ID number and the commission earned on the rental.
