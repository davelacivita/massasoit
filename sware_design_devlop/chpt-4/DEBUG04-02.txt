// This pseudocode should create a list that describes annual profit
// statistics for a retail store. Input records contain a department
// name (for example, “Cosmetics”) and profits for each quarter for
// the last two years. The program should determine whether
// the profit is higher, lower, or the same
// for this full year compared to the last full year.
